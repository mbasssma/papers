# Title
Measurements - model comparison of secondary organic aerosol over West Africa


# Write introduction section further
We present measurements of SOA over West Africa.
The measurements were made using AMS, as described in Bloggs et al 2004.
Smith et al have made extensive measurements in this region before, but they haven't yet answered the important question of X.

# Simulations
We simulate formation of SOA over W Africa, using Johns marvellous magical model.

# Methodology
We compared simulations from model Y (Smith et al, 2005) with our measurements.

# Results
Our simulations did a great job of reproducing the measurements.

# Conclusions
We have made fantastic insight into the particle formation process.
Nonetheless, questions remain unanswered, so maybe we should get some more money.

# Figures
Add figures here. It's a draft.
