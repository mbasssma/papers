# Title
Measurements of secondary organic aerosol over West Africa

# Write introduction section
We present measurements of SOA over West Africa.
The measurements were made using AMS, as described in Bloggs et al 2004.
Smith et al have made extensive measurements in this region before, but they haven't yet answered the important question of X.

# Simulations
We simulate formation of SOA over W Africa, using Johns marvellous model.
